## Title

Week 1 homework - refactoring HTML + CSS

## Description

The aim of this project was to work to refactor an existing site (HTML + CSS) to make it more accessible, to amend errors within the CSS + HTML, and to generally tidy up the code.

This included:

- amending HTML to include semantic elements
- fixing broken links
- adding alt elements to images to improve accessibility
- improving quality of the title element
- consolidating the selectors and properties in the CSS and organizing them to follow the semantic structure of the HTML elements
- including comments before each element or section of the page to make the code more easily readable.
